# Python-Crash-Course
I'm going through the book "Python Crash Course, 2nd Ed." by Eric Matthes to learn Python, and this is where I'm going to keep the collection of random scripts I've made going through the book. Some will be directly from the exercises throughout, some will deviate from the exercises.

I currently have Python version 3.8.10 installed and am using VSCodium as my IDE.
